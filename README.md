# Guiding Principles

Fluck is not a fling. We've held this vision for over a decade, waiting for the right moment. Now, with more and more creative entrepreneurs getting frustrated with existing platforms, we think the time is right.

Building a new platform for the community is no small feat. It requires solid guidelines to ensure we don't deviate from our path. The guiding principles below serve that purpose. Not lofty promises from the founders, but a toolkit to help everyone involved reach the destination we set out for at the start.

## The Principles

### 01. Stay independent

No selling out, no external pressure. The right partner might help someday, but there's no “exit strategy”.

### 02. Enough is enough

Stay small, maintainable, and focused. When growth threatens quality, pause and refocus. Human-scale progress is the path to sustainability.

### 03. Build for sustainability

Choose partners who share our environmental values. Write efficient code, avoid unnecessary features, and optimize for efficiency.

### 04. Community at the core

Creatives thrive together. Build a supportive network for sharing, collaboration, and inspiration. A true community, not mere transactions.

### 05. Keep it human

Foster direct, authentic connections between makers and buyers. No algorithmic ranking, no hidden push or pull.

### 06. Celebrate individuality

Protect every maker's voice and authorship. Genuine, tangible, human-made work is at the heart.

### 07. Accessible by design

Embrace inclusivity from the start. Compliance with standards is the baseline, not the goal. Consider all abilities and devices; everybody should feel welcome.

### 08. Usability first

Simple, powerful, and easy to learn. Keep it clear and light, so creators can focus on what they do best.

### 09. Stay lean

Every feature must serve creative people directly. Avoid bloat and listen to real user needs.

### 10. Be stable, be boring

Reliability matters most. No changes for change's sake. Improve incrementally, keeping things dependably solid.

### 11. Move deliberately slow

Long-term sustainability over short-term wins. Sleep on big decisions, and research alternatives. Choose what _not_ to do as carefully as what to do.

### 12. Resist the hype

Only adopt what clearly benefits real users. Favour proven technologies over whatever's hot.

### 13. Operate transparently

Share how things work. Open communication, clear decisions, honest pricing. No dubious changes, no surprise fees, no hidden commissions.

### 14. Users own their data

Content, customer lists, and personal information belong to users. Act as a custodian, not the owner.

### 15. Freedom of movement

You can't please everyone. If it's not a match, anyone should be able to move out. Full export capabilities, no barriers, no questions asked.

### 16. Give back

Open-source the code and support key software projects.
